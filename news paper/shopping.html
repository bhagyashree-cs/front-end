                          Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other 
                          animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used 
                          and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible 
                          plant matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, 
                          roots, and seeds. An alternate definition of the term is 
                          applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by culinary and cultural 
                          tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that 
                          are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include 
                          savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as 
                          broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.

                   Books are referred to as a man’s best friend. They are very beneficial for 
                   mankind and have helped it evolve. 
                   There is a powerhouse of information and knowledge. 
                   Books offer us so many things without asking for anything in 
                   return. Books leave a deep impact on us and are responsible for 
                   uplifting our mood.This is why we suggest children read books 
                   from an early age to gain knowledge. The best part about books 
                   is that there are various types of books. One can read any type 
                   to gain different types of knowledge. Reading must be done by 
                   people of all ages. It not only widens our thinking but also 
                   enhances our vocabulary.

                  Perfume is a mixture of fragrant essential oils or aroma 
                  compounds, fixatives and solvents, usually in liquid form, 
                  used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and 
                  living-spaces an agreeable scent.[1] The 1939 Nobel Laureate 
                  for Chemistry, Leopold Ružička stated in 1945 that "right from 
                  the earliest days of scientific chemistry up to the present 
                  time perfumes have substantially contributed to the development 
                  of organic chemistry as regards methods, systematic classification, 
                  and theory.Ancient texts and archaeological excavations show 
                  the use of perfumes in some of the earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as vanillin or coumarin, which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from natural aromatics.

                        A detergent is a surfactant or a mixture of surfactants with cleansing 
                        properties in dilute solutions.These substances are usually alkylbenzene 
                        sulfonates, a family of compounds that are similar to soap but are more 
                        soluble in hard water, because the polar sulfonate (of detergents) is less 
                        likely than the polar carboxylate (of soap) to bind to calcium and other ions 
                        found in hard water.In domestic contexts, the term detergent by itself refers 
                        specifically to laundry detergent or dish detergent, as opposed to hand soap or 
                        other types of cleaning agents. Detergents are commonly available as powders or 
                        concentrated solutions. Detergents, like soaps, work because they are amphiphilic: 
                        partly hydrophilic (polar) and partly hydrophobic (non-polar). Their dual nature 
                        facilitates the mixture of hydrophobic compounds (like oil and grease) with water. 
                        Because air is not hydrophilic, detergents are also foaming agents to varying degrees.
